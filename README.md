# Mizu
<b>An Interactive ADT Visualizer</b>

This is a public facing repository to keep track of the project progress and announcements.


MIZU is a web app to visualize algorithms and data structure routines live on screen. The user will be able to see the transformations and data movements , real-time, as it responds to user events.


A working demo is available on youtube.

Mizu goes live in September.


Backend hosts the Server and the Algorithms library which power the simulations on the backend. This Algorithms library houses ADTs based on structures :
> - Tree 
> - Heap
> - Trie
> - Queue
> - Stack
> - List
> - Graph



All of the ADTs in this library are my own implementations. As a function of being an interactive visualizer, the simulations on user side are real-time, not pre-rendered.

Todos
-----

### HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES:

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Finish Tree section

### GRANULAR LEVEL PRIORITIES:


- HIGH PRIORITY : Fix margins so nodes do not overlap

- HIGH PRIORITY : For every user operation -> highlight, with a specific color, the node and element the Btree is acting upon, through which the end-user has a fair idea of the current flow of events.

- Remedy the issue of branches staying a step too long at dead spots

- Make transitions smoother. No cutscenes in between (Maybe add an inorganic hack with an animation step...?)

- Fix text-centering inside Nodes

- Labelling is bad... Improve it

- Brief documentation on each ADT


TECH
----

### Backend Tech

* [ZeroMQ] - Message Queues and Services Orchestration of worker threads for simulation
* [Java] - Backend in based on a Java ecosystem
* [NodeJS] - Websockets proxy relay
* [Redis] - session and caches


### Frontend Tech

* [HTML5] - UI
* [CSS3] - UI
* [Javascript ES6] - Visualisation Lib written in Vanilla JS to relay data transformations on client-side
* [Websockets] - Native WebSockets API

### And of course Internets and People! Without them I'd get nowhere.
